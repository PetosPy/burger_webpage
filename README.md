second attempt at web design using HTML and CSS and I would say this is something I might enjoy doing.

Its an interesting project for me since it's my first time coming accross HTML and CSS, just hearing the
words html and css was very frightnening at first but once you get to use them and treat them as tools 
it is actually very fun building websites.
Although no JS is involved I would say building basic static websites is a must for every programmer,
you get o see how the websites you visit on a daily basis work.
